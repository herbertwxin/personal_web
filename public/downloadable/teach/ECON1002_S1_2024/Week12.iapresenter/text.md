## Concept Review
	1. Nominal vs. Real Exchange Rate
	2. Purchasing Power Parity Theory
	3. Impossible Trinity


---
### Nominal Exchange Rate
	**Relative value between two currencies**
	*Example:* Australian Dollar vs. Japanese Yen
	$$e_{JPY,AUD}=\frac{JPY}{AUD}$$
	This reads "==the amount of JPY you can buy with 1 AUD=="
	If $e_{JPY,AUD}=100$, 
	we say "you can get 100 JPY with 1 AUD."

---
### Real Exchange Rate
	**The price of average domestic goods in terms of the average foreign goods**
	$$q\equiv e \times \frac{P}{P^f}$$
	This equation reads "==real exchange is equivalent to nominal exchange rate times the relative price level between two countries=="
	*Rearrange this equation gives*
	$$q\equiv e \times \frac{P}{P^f}= \frac{JPY}{AUD}\cdot \frac{P_{aus}}{P_{jp}}=\frac{JPY}{P_{jp}}/\frac{AUD}{P_{aus}}$$
	$\frac{JPY}{P_{jp}}$ is the real value of JPY and $\frac{AUD}{P_{aus}}$ is the real value of AUD
	==This is just the real relative value between two currencies==

---
### Nominal Rate
	The relative value between two currencies
	$$e_{JPY,AUD}=\frac{JPY}{AUD}$$
### Real Rate
	The **real** relative value between two currencies
	$$q\equiv e \times \frac{P}{P^f}= \frac{JPY}{AUD}\cdot \frac{P_{aus}}{P_{jp}}=\frac{JPY}{P_{jp}}/\frac{AUD}{P_{aus}}$$

---
### Law of One Price
	==The real value of the same good should be the same across countries== [^Assuming transportation cost is low, and arbitrage is possible] 
	Why? *If people found iPhone is more expensive in Australia compares to the State, they will buy it in U.S. and resell it in Australia.*
### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Theory
	==Nominal exchange rate are determined such that **Law of One Price** holds==
	iPhone (US): \$1, iPhone (AUS) = AUD\$2, then $e_{USD,AUD}=0.5$
	*Shortcomings:* PPP doesn't always hold in the short-run. **Why?**
	- Many goods are not traded globally
	- Goods are not identical

---
### Impossible Trinity
	- **Option A**
		- Give up monetary independence for fixed exchanged rate and free capital flow, ==Hong Kong (China)==
	- **Option B**
		- Give up fixed exchange rate for free capital flow and independent monetary policy, ==U.S.==
	- **Option C**
		- Give up free capital flow for fixed exchange rate and independent monetary policy, ==China (*Arguably*)==

##### 1. How would each of the following be likely to **affect the value of AUD**, all else being equal? Explain

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*Australian shares are perceived as having become much riskier financial investments.*


---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*Australian shares are perceived as having become much riskier financial investments.*
	==AUD depreciates as higher risk decreases investors demand on AUD.==


---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*European computer firms switch from Australian-produced software to software produced in India, Israel and other nations.*

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*European computer firms switch from Australian-produced software to software produced in India, Israel and other nations.*
	==Demand for Australia goods (software) decreases, so demand for AUD decreases, so the value of AUD depreciates.==

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*As East Asian economies recover, international financial investors become aware of many new, high-return investment opportunities in the region.*

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*As East Asian economies recover, international financial investors become aware of many new, high-return investment opportunities in the region.*
	==Investors switch their attention to the East Asian market, which decreases the demand for AUD, AUD depreciates.==

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*The Australian government imposes a large tariff on imported automobiles.*

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*The Australian government imposes a large tariff on imported automobiles.*
	==Australians buy less foreign automobiles, i.e. decreasing the supply of AUD to the global market, AUD appreciates.==
---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*The Reserve bank reports that it is less concerned about inflation and more concerned about an impending recession in Australia.* [^The tricky one] 

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*The Reserve bank reports that it is less concerned about inflation and more concerned about an impending recession in Australia.* 
	==If recession indeed hits, RBA lowers policy rate, making Australian financial assets less attractive, decreasing the demand for AUD, AUD depreciates. This could be offset by another effect of recession, which is lowered demand for foreign goods, which lowers the supply of AUD, leading to AUD appreciating.==

---
	###### How would this affect the value of AUD?
	*Australian consumers increase their spending on imported goods.*

	##### 2. A **British-made** car is priced at **20,000 pounds** and a comparable **Australian-made** car costs **$26,000**. **One pound trades for $1.50** in the foreign exchange market. 
	> *Find the real exchange rate for cars from the perspective of Australia and from the perspective of Great Britain. Which country’s cars are more competitively priced?*

---
### From the question
	British car: ￡20,000
	Australian car: $26,000
	Exchange rate: 1.5 dollar/pound


	If we apply the formula:
	$$\begin{align*}
	q &\equiv e \times \frac{P}{P^f} \\
	&= \frac{GBP}{AUD}\cdot \frac{P_{aus}}{P_{eng}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{1.5} \cdot \frac{26,000}{20,000} =0.867
	\end{align*}$$
	which is the price of Australian car relative to British car, vice versa we get 1.154
---
### In AUD
	British car costs ￡20,000 ⨉ 1.5 = $30,000 
	Australian car, on the other hand, costs $26,000
	*If we assume both cars has then same quality, then Australian car is priced more competitively.*

### In Pound
	Australian car costs $26,000/1.5 = ￡17,333
	British car, on the other hand, costs ￡20,000
	*If we assume both cars has then same quality, then Australian car is still priced more competitively.*
	==**Either way, we should find Australian car to be cheaper**==

##### 3. The demand for and supply of shekels in the foreign exchange market is
	$\text{Demand}=30,000-8,000e$ 
	$\text{Supply}=25,000+12,000e$
	where the nominal exchange rate is expressed as dollars per shekel.
	> *a. What is the **fundamental value of shekel**?*


---
	> $\text{Demand}=30,000-8,000e$ 
	$\text{Supply}=25,000+12,000e$
	
	We find **fundamental value**[^Fundamental value refers to the price of shekels when there is no shock, i.e. the equilibrium value, so we just solve for the equilibrium price, where demand equals supply.] of a currency by solving for the equilibrium. 
	$$30,000−8,000𝑒=25,000+12,000𝑒$$
	$$e=0.25 (\text{dollar/shekel})$$


---
	> b. *The shekel is **fixed at $0.30**. Is the shekel **overvalued, undervalued or neither**? Find the **balance of payments** deficit or surplus in both shekels and dollars. What happens to the country’s **international reserves** over time?*
	
	Note: **fundamental value** of shekel is $0.25

---
	**Fundamental value** of shekel is $0.25, if shekel is fixed at $0.3, then shekel is ==overvalued==. 
	If we find the corresponding supply and demand:
	$$\begin{align*}
	\text{Demand} &=30,000−8,000⋅0.3=27,600 \\
	\text{Supply}&=25,000+12,000\cdot 0.3=28,600\\
	\Delta D/S &= -1,000
	\end{align*}$$
	==Balance of payment deficit for shekels, surplus for dollar==
	Israel needs to **buy up the excess supply** in shekels, so their ==international reserves will decrease will lower overtime==.

---
	**Fundamental value** of shekel is $0.25, if shekel is fixed at $0.2, then shekel is ==undervalued==. 
	If we find the corresponding supply and demand:
	$$\begin{align*}
	\text{Demand} &=30,000−8,000⋅0.3=28,400 \\
	\text{Supply}&=25,000+12,000\cdot 0.3=27,400\\
	\Delta D/S &= 1,000
	\end{align*}$$
	==Balance of payment surplus for shekels, deficit for dollar==
	Israel needs to **print more shekels to meet the excess demand** for shekels, so their ==international reserves will increase overtime==.

---
### Advantages
	- Big Mac available in many countries 
	- Big Mac is **always the same** (mostly)
	- McDonald's holds **monopolistic power** among most countries 
	- Nice basis the international comparison 

### Disadvantages
	- Burgers are not traded across borders, ==no arbitrage== to ensure law of one price
	- It’s pricing depends on the ==price of local ingredients== rather than purchasing power of the currency
	- So it’s pricing mainly ==reflects local wages and rents==, which is non-tradable or not very mobile

	> b. *On 21 July 2010, the nominal exchange rate was ==AUD $1 = USD $0.8850 (1.13)==. On 8 October 2010, the nominal exchange rate was ==AUD $1 = USD $0.9835 (1.02)==. Suppose currency speculators read The Economist. Can you **explain this change in the nominal exchange rate**? Discuss.*

	> b. *On 21 July 2010, the nominal exchange rate was AUD ==$1 = USD $0.8850 (1.13)==. On 8 October 2010, the nominal exchange rate was AUD ==$1 = USD $0.9835 (1.02)==. Suppose currency speculators read The Economist. Can you **explain this change in the nominal exchange rate**? Discuss.*
	
	From the table, AUD is overvalued, **1 USD = 1.13 AUD**, **but 1 USD can buy 1.17 AUD worth of good**, so AUD is ==over-valued==. 
	On 8 Oct 2010, AUD is ==even more over-valued==, as now **1 USD = 1.02 AUD**. 
	This implies there is some shock made AUD over-valued in the short-run, but when price starts to adjust in the long-run, AUD should no longer be over-valued.
