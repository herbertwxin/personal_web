# Concept Review
	1. Current account
	2. Capital account
	3. Balance of payment
	4. Twin deficits


---
## Current account (CAB)
	> Records all transactions in a year on exchange of goods and services.
	
	- Payment inflow $\rightarrow$ Credit ($+$) 
		- *Purchases of AUD in FX market, i.e. purchasing AUS goods/services.*
	- Payment outflow $\rightarrow$ Debit ($-$)

---
### Capital Account (KAB)
	> Transactions in a year on asset transfers.
	
	- Capital inflow $\rightarrow$ Credit ($+$)
	- Capital outflow $\rightarrow$ Debit ($-$)
	Affected by **interest rates** and **perceived risks**


---
	### Effect of interest rate
	- Higher interest rates lead to more capital inflows
	- Lower interest rates lead to more capital outflows

### Effect of risk
	Increased perceived risk can lower capital inflow given the same interest rate
	That is, a **leftward shift** of the KI curve


---
## Balance of Payments
	> Balance of payments is simply the summation of capital account (KAB) and current account (CAB)
	
	$$BP=CAB+KAB$$
	Excess supply of currency $\rightarrow BP<0$ 
	- **Why?** Excess supply $\rightarrow$ more import than export, or/and, more capital outflow than inflows $\rightarrow CAB <0, KAB <0$
	
	Excess demand of currency $\rightarrow BP>0$ 

---
### Floating exchange rate
	Floating exchange rate means the exchange rate is **free to move** around.
	- At ==excess demand, currencies appreciate==
	- At ==excess supply, currencies depreciate==
	
	Then **after market adjustment**
	$BP=0 \implies CAB = - KAB$
	i.e. capital and current account offset each other.


---
### Twin Deficits
	$$T-G<0 \implies NX<0$$
	In words, government budget deficit $\implies$ trade deficit.
	- **Why?** Excess government spending decreases saving, which increases the need for foreign capital.

# Tutorial Questions

---
##### 1. Use a demand and supply diagram to illustrate the effects of a speculative attack on an overvalued exchange rate.

---
	What will speculator do?

---
	What will speculator do?
	- Sell the currency while the value is high
	
	**How would that change the equilibrium?**

---
	==Speculative attack made the economy even worse.==
#### Any solutions?
	- Devaluation (increasing the supply)
	- Imposing restrictions on trade and capital flow
	- Use reserves to buy up the excess supply
	- Tighter monetary policy to increase fundamental value


---
##### 2. Use a diagram to illustrate the effects of each of the following on the **capital investment** of a country that is a **net borrower from abroad**

---
##### a. Investment opportunities improve owing to new technologies.

	More investment $\rightarrow$ to higher capital inflows

##### b. The government budget deficit rises.

---
	==Budget deficit squeeze out national saving==
	$$S_{\text{public}} = T-G$$
	$$S_{\text{private}} = Y-C-T$$


This country is a net borrower from abroad! $\implies$ A higher interest rate leads to higher investment from abroad

##### 3. How does each of the following transactions affect (1) the **current account balance** and (2) the **capital account balance** for Australia? Show that in each case the identity that the **trade balance plus net capital inflows equals zero applies**.

---
##### a. An Australian exporter sells software to Israel. She uses the Israeli shekels received to buy stock in an Israeli company.

---
##### a. An Australian exporter sells software to Israel. She uses the Israeli shekels received to buy stock in an Israeli company.
	Software sale to Israel $\implies$ CAB ($+$)
	Purchase of Israeli shares $\implies$ KAB ($-$)
	We have both credit and debit, BP = 0 holds

---
##### b. An East Timorese firm uses proceeds from its sale of oil to Australia to buy Australian government bonds

---
##### b. An East Timorese firm uses proceeds from its sale of oil to Australia to buy Australian government bonds
	Oil purchase $\implies$ CAB ($-$)
	Bond purchase $\implies$ KAB ($+$)
	Both credit and debit, BP = 0 holds


---
##### c. An East Timorese firm uses proceeds from its sale of oil to Australia to buy oil-drilling equipment from an Australian firm


---
##### c. An East Timorese firm uses proceeds from its sale of oil to Australia to buy oil-drilling equipment from an Australian firm
	Oil purchase $\implies$ CAB ($-$)
	Sale of drilling equipment $\implies$ CAB ($+$)
	Both credit and debit, BP = 0 holds


---
##### d. An East Timorese firm receives Australian dollars from selling oil to Australia. A French firm accepts the dollars as payment for drilling equipment. The French firm uses the dollars to buy Australian government bonds.

	Oil purchase $\implies$ CAB ($-$)
	Bond purchase $\implies$ KAB ($+$)
	We have both credit and debit, BP = 0 holds


---
##### e. A British financial investor writes a cheque on his bank account in New York to purchase AMP shares.


---
##### e. A British financial investor writes a cheque on his bank account in New York to purchase AMP shares.
	Shares bought $\implies$ KAB ($+$)
	Shares move overseas $\implies$ KAB ($-$)
	Both credit and debit, BP = 0 holds

---
##### 4. Explain why “a **low-saving, high-spending** country is likely to import more than a high-saving country”.


---
	- Low saving rate $\implies$ low supply
	- High spending $\implies$ high demand
	- High demand & low supply $\implies$ high real interest rate
	- Higher interest rate attracts foreign investments 

---
#### Production function perspective 
	Low saving $\implies$ small $k$
	$y=Ak^\alpha \implies$ low output
	High spendings then turn toward imports 
---
##### 5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of flexible vs. fixed exchange rate system? Is one exchange rate system superior to the other? Discuss.

---
### Flexible exchange rate
	In the medium and the long run, insulates the economy from external shocks (e.g. foreign inflation shocks) as the flexible exchange rate absorbs such shocks.
	$$q\equiv e \times \frac{P}{P^f}$$
	$e$ is the differential between foreign and domestic inflation

---
### Flexible exchange rate
	Monetary authorities are free to pursue other goals, 
	e.g. inflation or full employment.


---
### Fixed exchange rate
	Minimize exchange rate uncertainty and lowers transaction costs by promoting certainty.

---
### Fixed exchange rate
	Advocates are of belief that exchange rate markets are frequently subject to destabilizing speculation. That is, demand and supply forces reflect speculative forces, rather than fundamentals.


---
### Fixed exchange rate
	Benefits of a “common currency” if every country follows.

---
### In general 
	Flexible exchange rates are preferable **except** when
	- A group of countries is tightly integrated, they experience similar real shocks, and/or there is high factor mobility between them. ==EU==
	- A central bank (or policymakers lacking internal discipline) cannot be trusted. ==Argentina etc.==

---
# *Note!*
	Advantages of flexible ER system are disadvantages of a fixed ER system and vice versa.
	**There is no one best system for all!!**
