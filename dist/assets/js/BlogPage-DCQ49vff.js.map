Whereas in capitalist system, firms are immediately constrained by demands from the market, avoiding overly occupying social resources. In all circumstances, however, firms prioritize the most immediate constraint as it decides the survival of the firm. Thus, socialist firms suffer from \"investment hunger\", which relentlessly push for expansion regardless of actual market demands or the efficient use of resources to maintain state support till the exhaustion of resources, creating shortages.\n\n## A Political Perspective\n\nThe detachment of firms from the market could certainly be undesirable. The detachment of local government from its residents, however, could raise more issues. In fact, any autocratic state should suffer from this issue more or less.\n\nAs the nature of all autocratic system, local government officials are appointed by its superior, which means their responsibilities lies in achieving need of the superior. That need, however, does not necessary align with those from the residents. Put it into Karnai's framework, local government in autocratic state is delimited by the by its interaction with superior, while in democratic state, it is delimited by the interaction with local resident. This is an analogous of the resource/demand constraint faced by socialist/capitalist firms. Thus, just like socialist firms have no incentive to save resources, autocratic local governments have no incentive to benefit its residents.\n\nThis lack of incentive occurs even when the central government's ultimate goal is to benefit the populace, as any policy relies on local government's implementation. With its hard constraint bounded by the populace, local government has to achieve the policy in a way that is generally agreed by the resident, where autocratic local governments, who's hard constraint is bounded by the central government, the policy can executed in any form, as long as it achieves the target.\n\nThe aforementioned idea could be illustrated using my **mushroom-shaped flowchart**.\n\n![Mushroom Flowchart](downloadable/blog/Mushroom.png)\n\nAs one could see from the chart, the local government has the ruling power towards the people, while its primary responsibility is not tied with the needs of people. Local government only has a secondary responsibility towards the populace, i.e. the people influence the central government, which governs the local government.\n\nSuch detachment between local government's responsibility and power has caused issues like the overly stringent lock-down policy during the COVID-19 era in China. The ultimate goal of the central government is to reduce the number of cases, which is certainly not wrong. However, since local government has no incentive to benefit its people, especially during such urgent event, it takes every measure at any cost to eliminate any possibility of COVID spreading, which, of course, includes killing dogs during break-in home COVID tests and leaving people that are suspect to be infected in Fangcang Hospital without any actual treatment. These measures obviously harms the welfare of general public and it does not matter as local government's primary responsibility, the one that decides the political career of local governor, is to fulfill the goal of the superior.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is sad to say this, but I think in any autocratic system, where the responsibility goes upward and power goes downward, faces the same problem. It shall be the intrinsic nature of autocratic systems, a steady state that any autocratic system converge to.`,\n    },\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      title: 'Fedora Silverblue Setup Guide',\n      excerpt: 'Here are some steps I would take after installing Fedora Silverblue',\n      date: '2023-12-25',\n      readTime: '15 min read',\n      tags: ['Fedora', 'Linux', 'Guide'],\n      content: `Feel free to contact me if you have any question with these instructions! Either through email or on the website's GitHub repository.\n\n> Many of the contents here are borrowed from [Willi Mutschler](https://mutschler.dev/linux/fedora-post-install/#). However, since I work with Fedora Silverblue rather than Fedora Workstation, many of the installation steps would be different due to the immutable nature of Silverblue. For that reason, I think this post would still show it's value.\n\nThe version used is Fedora Silverblue 39 at the time this post is written. Most of the softwares are probably more personal and economists-oriented.\n\n## Background Info for Silverblue\n\nSilverblue differs from the normal Fedora Workstation as it is immutable, meaning the system files are read-only and updates are installed as a whole. Put it more technically, \\`/\\` and \\`/usr\\` and everything below it is read-only, while stuffs under \\`/var\\` are user-changeable. For more information, please consult [Fedora Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/technical-information/).\n\nThis means Silverblue needs to install applications and packages differently from Workstation, i.e. \\`dnf install\\` will not work, more specifically, there are 3 ways to do it.\n\n### Flatpak\n\nFlatpak is the predominant way to install applications, as it places each application into a sandbox, aligning with the immutable approach of the Silverblue.\n\nIt is generally recommended to add Flathub repo to gain access to more applications, for instructions to do that, please consult [Fedora Doc](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/getting-started/).\n\n### Toolbox\n\nToolbox creates an isolated container to install packages and softwares, it is almost like a emulator of the host system, or like a self-contained system that is attached to the host system.\n\nTo create a toolbox, you can use the command:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncreate toolbox --container [name of container]\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAfter entering the toolbox\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ntoolbox eneter [name of container]\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nIt is possible to use the normal Fedora/RHEL command.\n\n### Layering\n\nLayering is against the immutable approach of the system, but, many packages benefits from layering as it is layer upon the system and has a more direct connection with the system. I would recommend only install very necessary packages using layering, like graphics card drivers etc.\n\nTo layer a package onto the system:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nrpm-ostree install [package name]\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nTo uninstall a layered package:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nrpm-ostree uninstall [package name]\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Graphics\n\n### Wayland & Xorg\n\nFedora uses Wayland as default and will depreciate Xorg gradually, but in practice the experience is quite awful if you have a Nvidia card with drivers not properly set up. However, lately advancement from Nvidia side has made Wayland quite usable, providing you installed all the drivers.\n\n#### Use Xorg\n\nBy using Xorg session, I can solve most displaying issues with VSCode and Obsidian (Both installed through Flatpak). To use Xorg instead of Wayland, uncomment \\`WaylandEnable=false\\` and add \\`DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop\\` to the [daemon] section of \\`/etc/gdm/custom.conf\\`\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nsudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf\n# [daemon]\n# WaylandEnable=false\n# DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop\n\n# Cuda libs for Xorg\nrpm-ostree install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda\nrpm-ostree install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda-libs\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAnd then reboot for the change to take effect.\n\n#### Nvidia & Wayland\n\nTo install the proprietary Nvidia driver\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nrpm-ostree update\n\n# Nvidia proprieatary driver\nrpm-ostree install akmod-nvidia\n\n# The Nvidia proprieatary driver doesn't support VAAPI, but there is a wrapper that can bridge NVDEC/NVENC with VAAPI\nrpm-ostree install nvidia-vaapi-driver\n\n# Provides more codec for video streaming\nrpm-ostree install libavcodec-freeworld\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAfter all the installations, follow the instruction and reboot the system\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nsystemctl reboot\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Softwares\n\n### Foliate\n\nI really like this handy software to read my \\`.epub\\` books, but it has some problem accessing the graphics card or some sort, resulting in the page not being able to render properly. I think the problem mostly lies with the fact of lack of permission.\n\nThe simplest way to fix this issue is to disable GPU acceleration for Foliate, to do that.\n\n1.  Install \\`Flatseal\\` either by GUI or command line\n2.  Disable the **GPU acceleration** option for Foliate\n3.  Problem fixed!\n\nSince **Foliate** is not a very demanding software, even without GPU acceleration the whole thing runs smoothly enough for me to not search for other solutions.\n\n### MATLAB\n\n#### Installation\n\nAlways refer to the official installation guide for more info.\n\n1. After the downloading the MATLAB installation file, unzip it with\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   \tunzip matlab_R2023b_glnxa64.zip -d matlab_R2023b_glnxa64\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n2. Navigate to \\`matlab_R2023b_glnxa64\\` directory and launch the installer with\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   ./install\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n3. Install MATLAB under \\`/var\\` directory so you have full permission, the way I do it is\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   /var/home/$USER/bin\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n#### Desktop Entry\n\nHere is a reference for what you need to put in for the desktop entry\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=/var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB/R2023b/bin/matlab -desktop\nName=MATLAB R2023b\nIcon=/var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB/bin/glnxa64/cef_resources/matlab_icon.png\nCategories=Development;Math;Science\nComment=Scientific computing environment\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer\nMimeType=text/x-matlab\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### Libraries\n\nAlthough [Willi Mutschler](https://mutschler.dev/linux/fedora-post-install/#) suggests that it is better to use system libraries instead of MATLAB's shipped libraries, as it solves most issues with MATLAB. During my experiment, this is not the case as with Silverblue, MATLAB does not have the access to system level files and is unable to utilize the system libraries. Thus, there is no need to exclude the shipped packages with MATLAB, in fact, you need to copy some packages from system to MATLAB directories for Dynare to work properly, as it cannot access system level file either.\n\n### Dynare\n\nDynare needs to be compiled from source on a Fedora-based system, and the method to do it is slightly different in Silverblue.\n\n#### Fundamental packages\n\nIn order to compile Dynare, we need to install several packages, I would recommend install these packages in a toolbox to align with the immutable approach.\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ntoolbox create --container Dynare-compile\n# Enter the toolbox\ntoolbox enter Dynare-compile\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nInstall all the packages inside this toolbox\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Minimal packages (use --disable-doc and --disable-octave flags)\nsudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-g++ gfortran boost-devel gsl-devel lapack lapack-devel matio-devel openblas openblas-devel suitesparse-devel bison flex make autoconf automake redhat-rpm-config\n# Octave packages (use --disable-doc flag)\nsudo dnf install -y octave octave-devel octave-statistics octave-io octave-optim octave-control\n# Documentation packages\nsudo dnf install -y texlive-scheme-minimal texlive-collection-publishers texlive-collection-latexextra texlive-collection-fontsextra texlive-collection-latexrecommended texlive-collection-science texlive-collection-plaingeneric texlive-lm python3-sphinx latexmk mathjax doxygen\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nNext, compile \\`solicot\\` and \\`x13as\\`, although I am not very sure the use of \\`x13as\\` as it is not directly involved in the compiling. The code below are from [Dynare compiling instruction for Fedora, CentOS or RHEL on GitLab](https://git.dynare.org/Dynare/dynare#fedora-centos-or-rhel).\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# compile slicot from source and put it into /home/$USER/dynare/slicot/lib/\nmkdir -p /var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot\ncd /var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot\nwget https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/slicot/slicot_5.0+20101122.orig.tar.gz\ntar xf slicot_5.0+20101122.orig.tar.gz\ncd slicot-5.0+20101122\nmake FORTRAN=gfortran OPTS=\"-O2 -fPIC -fdefault-integer-8\" LOADER=gfortran lib\nmkdir -p /var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot/lib\ncp slicot.a /var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot/lib/libslicot64_pic.a #for MATLAB\ncp slicot.a /var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot/lib/libslicot_pic.a #for octave\n\n# compile x13as from source and put it into /usr/bin/\nmkdir -p /var/home/$USER/dynare/x13as\ncd /var/home/$USER/dynare/x13as\nwget https://www2.census.gov/software/x-13arima-seats/x13as/unix-linux/program-archives/x13as_asciisrc-v1-1-b60.tar.gz\ntar xf x13as_asciisrc-v1-1-b60.tar.gz\nsed -i \"s|-static| |\" makefile.gf # this removes '-static' in the makefile.gf\nmake -f makefile.gf FFLAGS=\"-O2 -std=legacy\" PROGRAM=x13as\nsudo cp x13as /usr/bin/\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### Compile Dynare\n\nOnce the perquisite packages are sorted, we can start to compile Dynare.\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd /var/home/$USER/dynare\n# This uses the current unstable branch\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://git.dynare.org/dynare/dynare.git unstable\ncd unstable\n# Direct Dynare to your MATLAB path\nmeson setup -Dmatlab_path=/var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB -Dfortran_args=\"[ '-B', '/var/home/$USER/dynare/slicot/lib']\" -Dbuildtype=debugoptimized build-matlab\nmeson compile -C build-matlab\nninja -C build-matlab\nmeson install -C build-matlab\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThese steps shall give you a nearly workable Dynare, expect now it needs the latest \\`libstdc++.so.6\\` and \\`libstdc++.so.6.0.32\\` packages shipped with the system. As I mentioned before, Silverblue makes MATLAB lack the access to use the system shipped packages, rather, we have to rely on those shipped with MATLAB.\n\nTo do this, we first move the \\`libstdc++.so.6\\` and \\`libstdc++.so.6.0.32\\` packages came with MATLAB to an exclude folder and the copy-paste the one from our system into MATLAB.\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nexport MATLAB_ROOT=/var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB\ncd /var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64\nmkdir -p exclude\nmv libstdc++* exclude/\ncd /lib64\ncp libstdc++.so.6 /var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64\ncp libstdc++.so.6.0.32 /var/home/$USER/bin/MATLAB/sys/os/glnxa64\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis should give you a running Dynare, simply add Dynare into the directory in MATLAB after.\n\n### LaTeX\n\nI use LaTeX with VSCode for all my writings, but to use this combo is a bit harder in Silverblue. My approach is to install LaTeX in a toolbox and then let VSCode (and LaTeX Workshop) communicate with LaTeX stored inside the toolbox.\n\n#### Install TeX Live\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Create the LaTeX container\ntoolbox create --container LaTeX\ntoolbox enter LaTeX\n\n# Add the Tex Live repository if needed\nsudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/texlive/fedora/\n\n# Instal the package\nsudo dnf install texlive texlive-scheme-full texlive-extra-utils\n\n# Update the packages\nsudo dnf update texlive*\n\n# Verify the installation\ntex --version\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### VSCode and LaTeX Workshop extension\n\nSimply use the flatpak to install VSCode, the community maintained version works fine for me, or you could work a way to install the official one by layering or through toolbox.\n\nAfter installing VSCode, use the extension shop to install LaTeX Workshop extension.\n\nOnce LaTeX Workshop is install, we need to configure it so that it can communicate with LaTeX in the toolbox, for that, we need to edit the \\`settings.json\\` of VSCode\n\nChange the corresponding entries in the \\`settings.json\\` to be\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n// Only if you use LaTeX Utilities extension for word count etc.\n\"latex-utilities.countWord.path\": \"host-spawn\",\n\"latex-utilities.countWord.args\": [\"toolbox\",
